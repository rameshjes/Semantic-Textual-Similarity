2.1 The attributes of said class. <STOP> Also whether or not it is a subclass. <STOP> Also whether it is public private or protected. <STOP>
2.1 Information telling the compiler what data members and member functions belong to the class. <STOP>
2.1 Since class is user defined, the body of the declaration can contain members, that can be either data or function declarations, and optionally access specifiers. <STOP> Example for specifiers would be public, private, and protected. <STOP> There is the keyword Class and the Class body is enclosed with brackets -LRB- -RRB- . <STOP>
2.1 An object and data. <STOP>
