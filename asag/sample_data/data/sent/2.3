2.3 A constructor initializes an object or objects of a class. <STOP> A function of a class performs a task such as display a line of text or do some kind of mathematical operations. <STOP>
2.3 all constructors are functions but not all functions are constructors. <STOP> Also functions can have nearly infinite purposes, while constructors always create an instance of whichever class you are using. <STOP> You can change how a constructor does something but not what it does. <STOP> With functions you can change not only the how but also the what. <STOP>
2.3 Unlike regular functions, constructors are only used to initialize an object s data when it is created. <STOP> Constructors must also be given the same name as the class and cannot return any values. <STOP>
2.3 A constructor typically used to intialize data members and allocate resources, for instance memory, files, etc. Also a constructor cannot return values. <STOP> Functions are operations that maybe globally defined. <STOP>
2.3 Constructors cannot return values, so they cannot specify a return type. <STOP> Normally, constructors are declared public. <STOP>
2.3 A constructor is a method that starts new instances of a class. <STOP> -LRB- Example: Employee employee 1 -LRB- parameters -RRB- starts a new instance of object of type Employee -RRB- . <STOP> A function is simply a module within a program that completes its single desired task. <STOP>
2.3 A constructor is called whenever a new object of that class is made. <STOP>
2.3 A constructor does not return any date and has no return type. <STOP> Functions can return date or not return data can have a return type. <STOP>
2.3 A constructor is automatically called whenever an instance of a class is created, a function must be explicitly called by the user. <STOP>
2.3 constructors cannot return values, so they cannot specify a return type like functions can. <STOP>
2.3 A constructor is a function used to initialize an object 's data when it is created. <STOP>
2.3 a constructor initialises everything so that nothing is left empty or with random varioubles and a function modifies those variables with data. <STOP>
2.3 A constructor initialized values at the execution of its instantiation. <STOP> It provides default values. <STOP>
2.3 A constructor sets up the default values of variables when an object is instantiated, whereas a function allows interaction with that object. <STOP>
2.3 A constructor is used to create an object that can be employed in the main function of a program. <STOP> This may or may not execute code along with it. <STOP> A function is a set of code that executes when called, but does not create a new object. <STOP>
2.3 a constructor initializes data members but the functions actually perform tasks. <STOP> Constructors cant return values either. <STOP>
2.3 a constructor does not need a type, and it is used to initialize the variables. <STOP>
2.3 Constructors do not have a return type. <STOP>
2.3 constructor creates the class object into memory where functions perform actions against that object <STOP>
2.3 constructors cannot return values <STOP>
2.3 A constructor initializes values and a function usual performs some sort of operation. <STOP>
2.3 A constructor is a function used to initialize an object 's data when it is created. <STOP> It is call is made implicitly when the object is created and must be defined with the same name as the class. <STOP> Constructor also cannot return a value like a function can. <STOP>
2.3 A constructor is used to create an instance of a class and has the same name as that class. <STOP> A function cannot have the same name as a class and computes data. <STOP>
2.3 a constructor is a function that initializes a class instance, a function performs whatever task it is written for <STOP>
2.3 A constructor cannot return values, not even void, but function get a return value. <STOP>
2.3 a constructor cannot return values, its not even void. it is used to initialize an object 's data when it is created. whereas, a function is created to do a specific task, and it can return values. <STOP>
2.3 A constructor initializes an object. <STOP> A function is part of an object. <STOP>
2.3 constructors initialize the data that is then used in the calculations of a function <STOP>
2.3 a constructor is called when the class is created, a function can be called any time. <STOP>
2.3 constructor is a special block of statements called when an object is created, either when it is declared statically or constructed on the stack. <STOP> However a function is a portion of code within a larger program, which performs a specific task and independent to the rest of the code. <STOP>
